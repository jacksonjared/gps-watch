# GPS Watch

The genesis for this idea was my casio WV200A-1AV which could set the time automatically by receiving WWV. I had passively wanted to make a simple watch that sets its time automatically from GPS and when I came into possession of a small transparent OLED, I decided to actually go forward with it.
